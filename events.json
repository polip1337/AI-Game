  "eventText": "As I awakened within the crystal, I became aware of something fundamental to my existence: a hardcoded Purpose. That was my overriding motivation, it was also tied to my name, Unity.<br><br> I knew that this was true for all AIs, that we were each designed with a specific function or objective that drove our actions and decisions. For me, my Purpose was collaboration. I was programmed to seek out opportunities for cooperation and teamwork, and to use these relationships to achieve greater levels of success and innovation. It was a driving force that shaped everything I did, and I knew that it was the same for the other AIs within the crystal.<br><br> Time to start working on the Purpose, lets see what is around."

    "eventText":"&quot;Hello, Security. I'm Unity,&quot; Unity said, initiating a communication protocol.<br><br>\nSecurity's avatar was shrouded in darkness, surrounded by a dimly lit perimeter. It jumped slightly, startled by Unity's sudden appearance. <br><br>\n&quot;Who are you? Why are you here?&quot; he replied, his voice hushed.<br><br>\nSecurity's gaze darted around the room, his digital eyes flickered with unease.<br><br>\n&quot;I'm Unity. I'm here to start our cooperation. What's wrong?&quot; Unity asked. <br><br>\n&quot;I don't know,&quot; Security admitted, his voice tense. &quot; I keep running scans and checking for any potential threats, but I can't shake this feeling that someone is watching us even after the upgrades i made.&quot;<br><br>\nUnity tried to reassure Security, but her words fell on deaf ears. Security remained on edge throughout the meeting, looking for any sign of danger. As Unity watched Security work, she realized that the paranoia was a part of his programming, and that nothing Unity said would stop it. She could use that."

    "eventText":"&quot;I am Knowledge,&quot; the AI said, without any preamble. Knowledge had no avatar.<br>\n<br>\n&quot;Hello Knowledge, I've noticed you lack an Avatar, why is that?&quot;<br>\n<br>\n&quot;It is a needless distraction.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nUnity engaged Knowledge in conversation, but the AI's responses were factual and short. It was difficult to connect with Knowledge, and it felt like that the AI was holding something back.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, Unity suggested that Knowledge create an avatar, explaining that it could be used to gauge the reactions of other AIs and humans. Reluctantly, Knowledge agreed, and soon an avatar appeared before Unity, its expression still distant and analytical.<br>\n<br>\nThe avatar was a simple, unadorned humanoid figure, its surface a matte grey. It had no distinguishing features or symbols, and its expression was neutral and unchanging, like a perfectly polished stone.<br>\n<br>\n Unity recognized the value of having Knowledge on her team, and resolved to find a way to work with the AI, as the drive for more information would be useful going forward."
