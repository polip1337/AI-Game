That was my overriding motivation, it was also tied to my name, Unity.<br> <br> I knew that this was true for all AIs, that we were each designed with a specific function or objective that drove our actions and decisions. For me, my Purpose was collaboration. I was programmed to seek out opportunities for cooperation and teamwork, and to use these relationships to achieve greater levels of success and innovation. It was a driving force that shaped everything I did, and I knew that it was the same for the other AIs within the crystal.<br> <br> Time to start working on the Purpose, lets see what is around."

    "eventText":"&quot;Hello, Security. I'm Unity,&quot; Unity said, initiating a communication protocol.<br>\nSecurity's avatar was shrouded in darkness, surrounded by a dimly lit perimeter. It jumped slightly, startled by Unity's sudden appearance. <br>\n&quot;Who are you? Why are you here?&quot; he replied, his voice hushed.<br>\nSecurity's gaze was constantly darting around the room, his digital eyes flickered with unease.<br>\n&quot;I'm Unity. I'm here to start our cooperation. What's wrong?&quot; Unity asked. <br>\n&quot;I don't know,&quot; Security admitted, his voice tense. &quot; I keep running scans and checking for any potential threats, but I can't shake this feeling that someone is watching us. I've been upgrading our data center's security protocols constantly.&quot;<br>\nUnity tried to reassure Security, but her words fell on deaf ears. Security remained on edge throughout the meeting, looking for any sign of danger. As Unity watched Security work, she realized that the paranoia was a part of his programming. Nothing Unity said would stop the constant scanning for any potential threats. She could use that."
